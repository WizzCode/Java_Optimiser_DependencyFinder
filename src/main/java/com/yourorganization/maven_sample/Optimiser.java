//the Visitors are classes which are used to find specific parts of the AST

//In most cases you will want to determine what you are looking for, then define a visitor that will
//operate on it. Using a visitor is very easy to find all nodes of a certain kind, like all the method
//declarations or all the multiplication expressions.

//Once we have a compilation unit to work with we can define our first visitor. Our visitor is going
//to extend a class named VoidVisitorAdaptor.
//Although that sounds like an odd name we can break in down into its constituent parts. The Void
//means weâ€™re not expecting the visit to return anything, i.e. this visitor may produce a side effect,
//but will not operate on the underlying tree. There are other types of visitors that will do this, which
//we will come to later.
//The Adaptor refers to the class being part of an adaptor pattern, which provided default implementations of the VoidVisitor interface, which accepts around 90 different types as arguments (see
//Appendix B for the full list). So when defining your own visitor you will want to override the visit
//method for the type you are interested in. In practice, this means that you can define only the method
//to handle a certain type of nodes (e.g. field declarations), while your visitor will not do anything
//with the dozens of other node types you are not interested in. If you were instead to implement
//VoidVisitor directly you would have to define dozens of methods, one for each node type: not very
//practical.
